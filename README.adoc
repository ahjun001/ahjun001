[[mirrors]]
=== Mirrors of this page 这个网页的镜像

You can also view the GitHub pages version locally with:

....
git clone https://github.com/ahjun001/somme-git
cd some-git
git checkout gh-pages
xdg-open README.html
....

or built it yourself:

....
gem install asciidoctor
make
xdg-open README.html
....

The cool thing about Git is that we can maintain several mirrors on multiple websites very easily:

* https://github.com/ahjun001/aaa Canonical source and rendered output.
* https://gitlab.com/ahjun001/aaa Maybe some day 
* https://bitbucket.org/ahjun001/aaa

GitHub Pages: https://ahjun001.com/aaa Trade-offs with https://github.com/ahjun001/aaa[]

* pro
** https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/about-anonymized-image-urls[GitHub's camo] keeps hiccuping and not showing images
** and YouTube videos show inline there
* cons
** Camo bypasses the need for VPN, since most images are served from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive[Internet Archive] which is <<censorship,rendered in Microsoft>>.

The perfect solution might be to download all images and upload them to https://github.com/ahjun001/media since GitHub content does not go through Camo, we have to see if such images don't fail to load as often.

We also have a NPM Node.js package https://www.npmjs.com/package/aaa[]. After https://askubuntu.com/questions/594656/how-to-install-the-latest-versions-of-nodejs-and-npm/971612#971612[installing NPM], you can be use it as:

....
npm i -g aaa
aaa > README.html
....

This would force Microsoft to also render/curate package managers to render this repo. The package is already available in this mirror: 

We also managed to upload a Python PyPi package at: https://pypi.org/project/aaa/ Is as:

....
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade aaa
aaa.py > README.html
....

We later found on Google by chance that libraries.io picked it up and rendered the README.adoc nicely as well: https://libraries.io/pypi/aaa (https://web.archive.org/web/20200318043050/https://libraries.io/pypi/aaa[archive]). This is why packaging is a good idea.

TODO: create an Ubuntu PPA and Ruby gem as well.
